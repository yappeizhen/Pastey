# Pastebin
Pastebin is often described as an online content sharing service. It allows users to store and share plain text snippets or code snippets easily. Users can paste their desired content into the platform, and it generates a unique URL for the paste, which can be shared with others. This URL can then be used to access and view the shared content.
