## Introduction

Welcome to the Technology Associate Program (TAP) Technical Take Home Assessment for GDS Central! We're excited to see what you can do. In this assessment, you will be provided with two problems to choose from. You will be required to complete only one problem.

Your task is to create a solution to the problem you choose. You can use any programming language or technology, but you must use a database. This database could be any database, such as DynamoDB, SQL, or Redis. It is important that your solution works on the evaluator's machine. Please note that storing files on the local machine is not acceptable.

Problem 1: [IP Address Management](./IPAM/IPAM.md)

Problem 2: [Snippet Sharing Service](./snippet-sharing-service/README.md)

## Instructions

1. Choose one of the two problems provided.
2. Create a solution to the problem you choose.
3. Use any programming language or technology, but make sure you use a database.
4. List down all technologies used, along with justifications (where applicable).
5. Write instructions on how to run your solution.
6. Add any additional features that you think will enhance your solution.
7. Submit your solution by the deadline.

For all work done, ensure that it exists in your Git repository. You may use either GitHub or GitLab for your Git repository. You must set your Git repository as private.

### Optional Features

In addition to the requirements, you can consider adding some features into your solutions, such as:

1. Containerize your solution
2. Deploy your solution to production (cloud, or otherwise)
3. Use infrastructure as code (IaC) to deploy your work
4. Integrate your code repo with a CI/CD solution
5. Use unit testing and/or integration testing where applicable
6. Design and implement a solution that is scalable, if applicable

### Submission Format

The assessment is to be completed within 72 hours upon receiving these instructions.

Please submit your solution using this form: https://go.gov.sg/tap-2023-gds-central-submission

1. Clean and well-structured code.
2. Use of appropriate design patterns and best practices.
3. Use of a database.
4. Additional features that enhance the solution.
5. Clear and concise documentation.

We wish you the best of luck and we're looking forward to seeing your solution!

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I ask for clarification on the problems?

A: No. Please interpret the problems to the best of your ability. We will be evaluating your ability to understand and interpret requirements. If you made any assumptions, clearly document them.

---

Q: What is the preferred programming language to use?

A: You can use any programming language or technology that you are comfortable with.

---

Q: Can I use third-party libraries or frameworks?

A: Yes, you can use third-party libraries or frameworks as long as they are open-source and free to use.

---

Q: Can I use {{advanced technologies}} (e.g. serverless, kubernetes)?

A: Yes, although we don't expect you to, and a working product demonstrates your skill better than an incomplete one. Just make sure you're genuinely comfortable with what you use and that your solution is replicable.

---

Q: Can I use existing code or third-party services / APIs that implement solutions to the chosen problem?

A: No, you are to implement the business logic on your own.

---

Q: Can I work with others on the assessment?

A: No, this is an individual assessment. You must complete the assessment on your own.

---

Q: What if I encounter technical difficulties while completing the assessment?

A: If you encounter any technical difficulties while completing the assessment, please reach out to us immediately. We will do our best to assist you.

---

Q: How will my solution be evaluated?

A: Your solution will be evaluated based on the criteria listed in the evaluation section. We will be evaluating your ability to create clean and well-structured code, use appropriate design patterns and best practices, use a database, add additional features to enhance your solution, and provide clear and concise documentation.

---

Q: Will implementing additional features help in my evaluation?

A: You are only required to implement features listed in the requirements section. Additional features outside of those listed in the "Optional Features" section will not be considered in your evaluation.

---

Q: Will implementing solutions for both problems help in my evaluation?

A: No. Please only submit 1 solution for 1 problem.

---

Q. What if I'm unable to complete all requirements for the solution?

A: You may still submit a working copy of all that you have completed thus far. Do remember to submit instructions on how to install / deploy / run your solution.

---

Q. What if I submit my solution after the deadline?

A: Timely submission is encouraged, and if you encounter difficulties, please inform us promptly. While we aim to accommodate unforeseen circumstances, late submissions may affect your assessment score.
